# Welcome to my profile !
I'm an IT student, and I like to try new things (languages, libraries and much more !) and sometimes my experiences ends up on my GitHub account, so feel free to take a look :wink: !

I'm also in a work-study program, currently working for the [DÃ©partement de Maine-et-Loire](https://github.com/Departement-de-Maine-et-Loire), a French administration.
